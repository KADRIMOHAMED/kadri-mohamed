## Challenge Objective  
For this challenge, I took on the role of a **BI Consultant** hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey.  

**Objective:**  
Plato's Pizza has been collecting transactional data for the past year but hasn't fully utilized it to drive sales and improve operations. The goal was to analyze the data and provide insights through a Power BI dashboard.  

The questions addressed in the analysis include:  
- **What days and times are the busiest?**  
- **How many pizzas are made during peak periods?**  
- **What are the best and worst selling pizzas?**  
- **What is the average order value?**  
- **How well is the seating capacity utilized?** (15 tables, 60 seats)  

Additional insights or ideas from the analysis were also encouraged.
